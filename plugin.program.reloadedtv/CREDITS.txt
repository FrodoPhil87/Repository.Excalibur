This guide is a forked version of TDB TV Guide which includes an amalgamation of code from Andys TV Guide, FTV Guide, 
On Tapp, Ivue and the original TV Guide by Twinthe

The foundations were set by twinther [script.tvguide](https://github.com/twinther/script.tvguide)
and others have since developed more to this gude.

Thank you both for your contribution to this amazing guide!

To get to this point the guide has been developed an maintained by many people, In no way do I claim to have designed, coded or
created this addon. I have mearly made changes to my liking and re-worked certian functions along with adding new functions/functionality.

There may very well be some issues flying around the community about the publication of this guide, but I have not done this
for any reason other than providing the END USER with what they want.

I will give credit to everyone before me and If I have missed you I am sorry, please ask and I will amend this list.

The credit for this guide goes to Andy and TDB Wizard, but the credit for the code that has been written must go to, in no particular order
